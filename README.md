# Gulp Starter

Automate your workflows with [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/).

## Template Features

- Modularize your HTML without any templating engine (see `src/layouts`).
- Compile SASS.
- Use PostCSS's most famous plugins such as Autoprefixer and CSSnano.
- `webpack-stream` to use Webpack along with `esbuild-loader` (the combination which in my opinion is the most sound way of bundling your JavaScript(or TypeScript) for all kinds of web browsers).
- HTML, CSS and JavaScript minification on production.
- Image optimization with `gulp-imagemin`.
- BrowserSync and live reloading.

## How to Use?

`yarn` or `npm install` to install all the dependencies and devDependencies.

`yarn dev` or `npm run dev` for development.

`yarn prod` or `npm run prod` for production.
